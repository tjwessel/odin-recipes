        <h1>Radicchio Salad with Citrus</h1>
        <img src="../img/radicchio-salad.jpeg" alt="Radicchio Salad" width=800>
        <h5>This bitter, peppery salad with its pop of bright, refreshing citrus will satisfy your craving for sunshine. Radicchio makes this colorful salad feel fresh, while quick homemade croutons and toasted walnuts settle your need for comfort food.</h5>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>For this recipe, any variety of citrus will work—you just need about two cups total of whatever you have on hand. It’s best to supreme the citrus, which means to trim the peel off the citrus, then cut the individual segments of fruit from the inner membrane.</em></p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>3 slices (about 2 cups) sourdough bread, torn into bite-sized pieces</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
                        <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</li>
                        <li>2 citrus fruits, like orange, lemon, and/or grapefruit</li>
                        <li>1 small head radicchio (about 4 cups), cored and cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
                        <li>2 cups arugula</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
                    </ul>
               
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make the croutons:</li>
                            <p>Heat the oven to 350 ̊F. Place the bread pieces on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with 1/4 cup olive oil. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and bake, tossing the bread on the baking sheet partway through, until golden and crunchy, about 15 minutes; let cool.</p>
                        <li>Toast the nuts:</li>
                            <p>While the croutons are in the oven, toast the nuts in a medium-sized skillet set over medium heat on the stovetop until fragrant and toasted, about 8-10 minutes. Stay near the pan, and stir the nuts occasionally. They can go from toasted to burnt in a matter of seconds. Let cool.</p>
                        <li>Peel and segment (a.k.a. supreme) the citrus:</li>
                            <p>For each fruit, cut about an inch off the top and bottom just so some of the flesh is exposed. Set the fruit with the cut-side down on a cutting board.</p>
                            <p>Start at the top, and slice down the side of the fruit with a sharp knife, cutting away the peel and the pith, exposing the flesh. Then carefully cut out the citrus segments over a bowl to collect the juice. You should have about 1 cup of citrus segments.</p>
                        <li>Squeeze the juice:</li>
                            <p>Once all of the segments have been removed, squeeze the juice from what's left of the fruit into the same bowl. Drain the juice from the segments and keep separate.</p>
                        <li>Make the citrus vinaigrette:</li>
                            <p>In a mason jar or small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of the reserved citrus juice with the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add pepper and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Secure the lid if using a jar, and shake vigorously for a few seconds until emulsified. If using a bowl, whisk the ingredients together.</p>
                        <li>Assemble the salad:</li>
                            <p>Add the radicchio and arugula to a large bowl. Drizzle with the vinaigrette and toss until evenly coated. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper to suit your preferences. Add the croutons, walnuts, citrus segments, and feta cheese, and toss until evenly combined.</p>
                        <li>To serve:</li>
                            <p>Transfer to a large serving bowl for family-style eating, or divide among individual bowls for serving.</p>
                    </ol>
