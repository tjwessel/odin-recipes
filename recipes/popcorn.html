        <h5>How to make a perfect batch of popcorn, with no burnt kernels! Easy stove-top popcorn recipe.</h5>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure the inside of the pot is completely dry before heating the oil in it, or else the oil will sputter.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil or extra virgin olive oil</li>
                        <li>1/3 cup high quality popcorn kernels</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon butter or more to taste, optional</li>
                        <li>Salt to taste</li>
                        
                    </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat the oil:</li>
                            <p>Heat the oil in a 3-quart thick-bottomed saucepan on medium high heat. If you are using coconut oil, allow all of the solid oil to melt.</p>
                        <li>Put 3 or 4 popcorn kernels into the oil:</li>
                            <p>Wait for the popcorn kernels to pop.</p>                         
                        <li>Add the rest of the popcorn:</li>
                            <p>When the kernels pop, add the rest of the 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels in an even layer</p>   
                        <li>Cover the pot, remove from heat and count 30 seconds:</li>
                            <p>(Count out loud! It's fun to do with kids.)</p>
                            <p>This method first heats the oil to the right temperature, then waiting 30 seconds brings all of the other kernels to a near-popping temperature so that when they are put back on the heat, they all pop at about the same time.</p>                         
                        <li>Return the pan to the heat:</li>
                            <p>The popcorn should begin popping soon, and all at once. Once the popping starts in earnest, gently shake the pan by moving it back and forth over the burner.</p>
                            <p><em><strong>Tip:</strong> As the popcorn pops, try to keep the lid slightly ajar to let the steam from the popcorn release (the popcorn will be drier and crisper).</em></p>
                        <li>Once the popping slows to several seconds between pops, remove the pan from the heat:</li>
                            <p>remove the lid, and dump the popcorn immediately into a wide bowl.</p>
                            <p>With this technique, nearly all of the kernels pop, and nothing burns.</p>
                        <li>Melt butter in the empty hot pan:</li>  
                            <p>If you are adding butter, you can easily melt it by placing the butter in the now empty, but hot pan.</p> 
                            <p><em><strong>Tip:</strong> if you let the butter get just a little bit brown, it will add an even more intense, buttery flavor to the butter and to your popcorn.</em></p>
                            <p>Just drizzle the melted butter over the popcorn and toss to distribute.</p>
                        <li>Sprinkle the popcorn with salt to taste:</li> 
                            <p>Fun toppings for the popcorn - Spanish smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, cayenne powder, chili pepper, curry powder, cumin, grated Parmesan cheese.</p>
